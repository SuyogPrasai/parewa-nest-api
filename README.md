- First install graphql-request to make the polling architecture

- Install @nestjs/schedule to schedule a polling request

- Found that we need to enable the post name in the link for graphql to work

- Need to add npm install @nestjs/config dotenv for using .env file

- The rate of pollings can be changed in the polling module in the serivice src/polling/polling.service.ts
